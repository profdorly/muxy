# Contributing to Muxy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Muxy! This guide will help you get started.

## Humans Only Policy

Muxy is a community project and we want communication to stay between humans. **AI-generated text is not allowed** in:

- Issue descriptions and comments
- Pull request titles, descriptions, summaries, and comments
- Discussion replies and code review comments

You are welcome to use AI to help you write code, but the text you post on GitHub must be written by you, in your own words. Issues and PRs with AI-generated text will be closed without review.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.0+
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) (`brew install swiftlint swiftformat`)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muxy-app/muxy.git
cd muxy
scripts/setup.sh          # downloads GhosttyKit.xcframework
swift build               # verify everything compiles
```

### Running

```bash
swift run Muxy
```

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run checks before committing:

```bash
scripts/checks.sh --fix   # auto-fix formatting and linting, then build and test
```

Optionally install the pre-commit hook to run formatting and linting automatically before each commit:

```bash
scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

4. Push your branch and open a pull request

## Code Standards

- **No comments in the codebase** — all code must be self-explanatory and cleanly structured
- **Early returns** over nested conditionals
- **Fix root causes**, not symptoms
- **Follow existing patterns** but suggest refactors if they improve quality
- **Security first** — no command injection, XSS, or other vulnerabilities

## Checks

All PRs must pass the full check suite. Run it with a single command:

```bash
scripts/checks.sh          # formatting → linting → build tests → test
scripts/checks.sh --fix    # auto-fix formatting and linting, then build and test
```

The script runs the following steps in order, stopping on the first failure:

1. **Formatting** — `swiftformat --lint .` (or `swiftformat .` with `--fix`)
2. **Linting** — `swiftlint lint --strict --quiet` (or `--fix` first with `--fix`)
3. **Build tests** — `swift build --build-tests --quiet`
4. **Test** — `swift test --quiet`

Tool versions are pinned in `.tool-versions` and the script validates them on startup. If your local versions don't match, it will tell you exactly what's expected.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Write a clear title and description explaining the "why"
- Ensure all checks pass before requesting review
- Link any related issues
- If contributed using AI, The LLM name is mandatory to be mentioned in the PR

## Reporting Issues

- Use the [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) template for bugs
- Use the [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) template for ideas
- Search existing issues before creating a new one
