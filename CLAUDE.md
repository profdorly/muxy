# Muxy

Requires macOS 14+ and Swift 6.0+. No external dependency managers needed — everything is SPM-based.

## Linting & Formatting

Requires `swiftlint` and `swiftformat` (`brew install swiftlint swiftformat`).

```bash
scripts/checks.sh             # Format, lint, build, test
scripts/checks.sh --fix       # Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
scripts/checks.sh --coverage  # Also run the coverage gate (slower; opt-in)
swiftformat --lint .          # Check formatting only
swiftlint lint --strict       # Check linting only
```

Run `scripts/checks.sh --fix` after every task.

Test processes use isolated Application Support storage.

## Validation

`scripts/checks.sh --fix` is the single validation entry point and must pass after every task. Muxy is a native macOS SwiftUI GUI app with no scriptable user flow, so agents must never attempt UI automation or QA against the running app. Compilation plus unit tests are the only automated validation. Visual behavior is verified manually by the user.

## Top Level Rules

- Security first
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Clean Code
- Clean Architecture
- Best Practices
- No Hacky Solutions
- No guessing and No assumption! Work with certainity.

## Main Rules

- No commenting allowed in the codebase
- All code must be self-explanatory and cleanly structured
- Use early returns instead of nested conditionals
- Don't patch symptoms, fix root causes
- For every task, Consider how it will impact the architecture and code quality, not just the immediate problem
- Follow the existing code's pattern but offer refactors if they improve code quality and maintainability.
- Use logs for debugging.
- If the feature is testable, then you must write tests.
- Never answer any question without a proper investigation and exploring the codebase.
- Prioritize problem comprehension over premature implementation. Validate the approach before execution to avoid rework
- Plan properly before executing to not double work
- Low memory and CPU usage is one of the key factors
- Simpler, flexible and scalable approaches are key factors
- Never run the app. User will run and test visually
- Documenting must be done accurate. At each round of tasks also review the related docs and fix/improve if needed.
- If contributed using AI, the LLM name is mandatory to be mentioned in the PR description.

## Extensions

- When providing API or hook or features to extensions, Make sure we update the extension SKILL and docs.
- Extension features usually need testing, offer a demo extension at ~/.config/muxy/extensions to the user.
- Prefix the demo extensions with `demo-*`

## Code Review

- Review the PRs/Code against the purpose of the PR/Issue/Asked. If you find unrelated issues to the PR during the review, Report them in a separate section.
- Apply review recommendations only after user's confirmation.
